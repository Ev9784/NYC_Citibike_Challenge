## Overview of the analysis:

Our team was assigned the project using Tableau to visualize data. The data was taken from Citibike and expanded to show how long bikes were checked out, as well as the genders of the users of the Citibikes renters; or team was also instructed to figure out the time(s) and day(s) of the week are Citibikes most used and are subscribers or customers the ones who are using Citibikes the most.
